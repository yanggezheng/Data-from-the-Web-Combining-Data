The course includes a special compiler-related capstone project, which ties together concepts of algorithms, theory (formal languages), programming languages, software engineering, computer architecture, and other subjects covered in the MS curriculum. This project requires a substantial semester-long programming effort, such as construction of a language compilation or translation system that includes lexical and syntactic analyzers, a type checker, and a code generator.\n",

       "<p>This class will be an introduction to the fundamentals of parallel scientific computing. We will establish a basic understanding of modern computer architectures (CPUs and accelerators, memory hierarchies, interconnects) and of parallel approaches to programming these machines (distributed vs. shared memory parallelism: MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL/CUDA). Issues such as load balancing, communication, and synchronization will be covered and illustrated in the context of parallel numerical algorithms. Since a prerequisite for good parallel performance is good serial performance, this aspect will also be addressed. Along the way you will be exposed to important tools for high performance computing such as debuggers, schedulers, visualization, and version control systems. This will be a hands-on class, with several parallel (and serial) computing assignments, in which you will explore material by yourself and try things out. There will be a larger final project at the end. You will learn some Unix in this course, if you don't know it already. Prerequisites for the course are (serial) programming experience with C/C++ (I will use C in class) or FORTRAN, and some familiarity with numerical methods.</p>\n",

The World Wide Web enables information flows among vast number of humans; Facebook, and LinkedIn, etc. connect small groups of friends; amazon, eBay, etc. provide opportunities for trading, etc, BitCoins, Ethereum, etc. allow parties to make financial and contractual transactions . These networks determine our information, influence our opinions, and shape our political attitudes. They also link us, often through important but weak ties, to other humans. Their origin is biological: going back to quorumsensing, swarming, flocking, social grooming, gossip, etc., and have evolved with the dynamics of evolutionary games (particularly Signaling Games). Yet, as we have connected our social networks to traditional human institutions (markets, justice systems, education, etc.) through new technologies, the underlying biology has become obscured, but not dormant. Economic markets also look much more like networks than anonymous marketplaces. Firms interact with the suppliers and customers in a Web-like supply chains. Systemic risk in financial markets often results from the counterparty risks created within this financial network. This course will introduce the tools for the study of networks, and mechanism designed to interact strategically: SmartContractss, Costly Signaling, Credible and Noncredible Threats, Model Checking and Verification, Safety and Liveness, Recommenders and Verifiers, Deception, Market mechanisms (pricing and auction), Privacy and Trust… Exampled Systems: Bit-coins, Zcash, Ripple, Stellar, Ethereum, Solidity, Rholang, DAO (Distributed Companies), Cyber Security (M-coins), Information Finance Markets (WealthFront, etc.), Market Microstructure, ICO/STO/ITO, GDPR, OpenLaw, OpenZeplin, ...</span></p>\n",

On the hardware side, we moved from single core processors to multicore/manycore processors. Multicore chips are now everywhere. You can find them in smartphones, playstations, notebooks, all the way up to supercomputers. To benefit from these chips, software must be parallelized, which starts another revolution in software. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to both the hardware advances and parallel programming techniques targeting multicore and manycore processors.

The goal of this course is to teach the skills needed for success in real-world information technology via a combination of classroom lectures and practical experience with large projects that have been specified by local “clients.” The typical clients are primarily companies, but can also be government agencies or nonprofit organizations. Each project lasts for the entire semester and is designed to involve the full software project life cycle. Examples of such projects are development of software to solve a business problem, including specifying requirements, writing and testing prototype code, and writing a final report; and evaluation of commercial software to be purchased to address a business problem, including gathering requirements, designing an architecture to connect the new software with existing systems, and assessing the suitability of available software products.</p>\n",

With the development of HTML5 and CSS3, there are now multiple ways to code images and animation natively in the browser. This course will provide a survey of current drawing techniques. We will create a series of Web-based projects that involve raster graphics, vector graphics, and interactivity using HTML, CSS, SVG, and JavaScript. Drawing on the Web builds upon foundations in Web design and computer programming with a focus on the range of graphics that can be coded into Web pages.</p>\n",

This is called sequential programming. We feel very comfortable with this because we think in a sequential way and give the machine statements to be executed in sequence. However, this has to change. A microprocessor with single core no longer exists in almost all computers we are using today (including your tablets and smart phones). Most of our devices are now multicore processors. A multicore processor contains several cores (called CPUs or cores) on-chip. To make the best use of these multicore chips we need to program them in-parallel. Sequential programming, for all platforms from smartphones to supercomputers, is falling out of fashion and taking back-seat to parallel programming. How to think in parallel? How to write code in parallel to make the best use of the underlying hardware? How is that new hardware different from the traditional one? What will the future be for the software and hardware?

       "<p class=\"CxSpFirst\">Natural Language Processing (aka Computational Linguistics) is an inter-disciplinary field applying methodology of computer science and linguistics to the processing of natural languages (English, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, etc.). Typical applications include: information extraction (automatically finding information from text); information retrieval (web searches and other applications involving the automatic selection of \"relevant\" documents); sentiment analysis (automatic extraction of opinions about a set of issues); and machine translation (automatically translating one natural language to another). Much of the best work in the field combines two methodologies: (1) automatically acquiring statistical information from one set of \"training\" documents to use as the basis for probabilistically predicting the distribution of similar information in new documents; and (2) using manually encoded linguistic knowledge. For example, many supervised methods of machine learning require: a corpus of text with manually encoded linguistic knowledge, a set of procedures for acquiring statistical patterns from this data and a transducer for predicting these same distinctions in new text. This class will cover linguistic, statistical and computational aspects of this exciting field.</p>\n",

It is almost impossible to imagine a world without them. Without robots, we would not have phones (mass-produced by robot manipulators), delivery services (fulfilled by mobile robots), or affordable electronics. But still, robots have ways to go. Open-ended problems with robots are endless from space exploration, self-driving, and general-purpose home assistants. In this class, we will take the first steps to creating machines that can think (robots). We will go over the fundamentals of robotic behavior by studying robot kinematics, dynamics, and control. Following this, we will study how robots can plan long-term behaviors in their environments without crashing into obstacles. Finally, we will see how modern ideas in optimization and AI can enable robotic grasping, self-driving, and walking. This introductory course will focus on understanding foundational robotic concepts, while broadly looking at their application in the real world.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n",

The course includes a special compiler-related capstone project, which ties together concepts of algorithms, theory (formal languages), programming languages, software engineering, computer architecture, and other subjects covered in the MS curriculum. This project requires a substantial semester-long programming effort, such as construction of a language compilation or translation system that includes lexical and syntactic analyzers, a type checker, and a code generator.\n",

       " <p>This class will be an introduction to the fundamentals of parallel scientific computing. We will establish a basic understanding of modern computer architectures (CPUs and accelerators, memory hierarchies, interconnects) and of parallel approaches to programming these machines (distributed vs. shared memory parallelism: MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL/CUDA). Issues such as load balancing, communication, and synchronization will be covered and illustrated in the context of parallel numerical algorithms. Since a prerequisite for good parallel performance is good serial performance, this aspect will also be addressed. Along the way you will be exposed to important tools for high performance computing such as debuggers, schedulers, visualization, and version control systems. This will be a hands-on class, with several parallel (and serial) computing assignments, in which you will explore material by yourself and try things out. There will be a larger final project at the end. You will learn some Unix in this course, if you don't know it already. Prerequisites for the course are (serial) programming experience with C/C++ (I will use C in class) or FORTRAN, and some familiarity with numerical methods.</p>\n",

The World Wide Web enables information flows among vast number of humans; Facebook, and LinkedIn, etc. connect small groups of friends; amazon, eBay, etc. provide opportunities for trading, etc, BitCoins, Ethereum, etc. allow parties to make financial and contractual transactions . These networks determine our information, influence our opinions, and shape our political attitudes. They also link us, often through important but weak ties, to other humans. Their origin is biological: going back to quorumsensing, swarming, flocking, social grooming, gossip, etc., and have evolved with the dynamics of evolutionary games (particularly Signaling Games). Yet, as we have connected our social networks to traditional human institutions (markets, justice systems, education, etc.) through new technologies, the underlying biology has become obscured, but not dormant. Economic markets also look much more like networks than anonymous marketplaces. Firms interact with the suppliers and customers in a Web-like supply chains. Systemic risk in financial markets often results from the counterparty risks created within this financial network. This course will introduce the tools for the study of networks, and mechanism designed to interact strategically: SmartContractss, Costly Signaling, Credible and Noncredible Threats, Model Checking and Verification, Safety and Liveness, Recommenders and Verifiers, Deception, Market mechanisms (pricing and auction), Privacy and Trust… Exampled Systems: Bit-coins, Zcash, Ripple, Stellar, Ethereum, Solidity, Rholang, DAO (Distributed Companies), Cyber Security (M-coins), Information Finance Markets (WealthFront, etc.), Market Microstructure, ICO/STO/ITO, GDPR, OpenLaw, OpenZeplin, ...</span></p>\n",

On the hardware side, we moved from single core processors to multicore/manycore processors. Multicore chips are now everywhere. You can find them in smartphones, playstations, notebooks, all the way up to supercomputers. To benefit from these chips, software must be parallelized, which starts another revolution in software. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to both the hardware advances and parallel programming techniques targeting multicore and manycore processors. You will learn how to make the best use of the underlying hardware to build applications that are faster, more power efficient, and more reliable.</font></font></font></span></div>\n",

To the extent feasible, the mathematical properties of the cryptographic algorithms are justified, using elementary mathematical tools. Second, actual security mechanisms and protocols, mainly those employed for network traffic that rely on the previously introduced cryptographic algorithms, are presented. The topics covered include introduction to basic number-theoretical properties, public/private and symmetric key systems, secure hash functions, digital signature standards, digital certificates, IP security, e-mail security, Web security, and stand-alone computer privacy and security tools.\n",

       " <p>This is a capstone course that connects students directly with real-world information technology problems. The goal of this course is to teach the skills needed for success in real-world information technology via a combination of classroom lectures and practical experience with large projects that have been specified by local “clients.” The typical clients are primarily companies, but can also be government agencies or nonprofit organizations. Each project lasts for the entire semester and is designed to involve the full software project life cycle. Examples of such projects are development of software to solve a business problem, including specifying requirements, writing and testing prototype code, and writing a final report; and evaluation of commercial software to be purchased to address a business problem, including gathering requirements, designing an architecture to connect the new software with existing systems, and assessing the suitability of available software products.</p>\n",

This is called sequential programming. We feel very comfortable with this because we think in a sequential way and give the machine statements to be executed in sequence. However, this has to change. A microprocessor with single core no longer exists in almost all computers we are using today (including your tablets and smart phones). Most of our devices are now multicore processors. A multicore processor contains several cores (called CPUs or cores) on-chip. To make the best use of these multicore chips we need to program them in-parallel. Sequential programming, for all platforms from smartphones to supercomputers, is falling out of fashion and taking back-seat to parallel programming. How to think in parallel? How to write code in parallel to make the best use of the underlying hardware? How is that new hardware different from the traditional one? What will the future be for the software and hardware? This is the topic of this course.</p>\n",

       " <p class=\"CxSpFirst\">Natural Language Processing (aka Computational Linguistics) is an inter-disciplinary field applying methodology of computer science and linguistics to the processing of natural languages (English, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, etc.). Typical applications include: information extraction (automatically finding information from text); information retrieval (web searches and other applications involving the automatic selection of \"relevant\" documents); sentiment analysis (automatic extraction of opinions about a set of issues); and machine translation (automatically translating one natural language to another). Much of the best work in the field combines two methodologies: (1) automatically acquiring statistical information from one set of \"training\" documents to use as the basis for probabilistically predicting the distribution of similar information in new documents; and (2) using manually encoded linguistic knowledge. For example, many supervised methods of machine learning require: a corpus of text with manually encoded linguistic knowledge, a set of procedures for acquiring statistical patterns from this data and a transducer for predicting these same distinctions in new text. This class will cover linguistic, statistical and computational aspects of this exciting field.</p>\n",

It is almost impossible to imagine a world without them. Without robots, we would not have phones (mass-produced by robot manipulators), delivery services (fulfilled by mobile robots), or affordable electronics. But still, robots have ways to go. Open-ended problems with robots are endless from space exploration, self-driving, and general-purpose home assistants. In this class, we will take the first steps to creating machines that can think (robots). We will go over the fundamentals of robotic behavior by studying robot kinematics, dynamics, and control. Following this, we will study how robots can plan long-term behaviors in their environments without crashing into obstacles. Finally, we will see how modern ideas in optimization and AI can enable robotic grasping, self-driving, and walking. This introductory course will focus on understanding foundational robotic concepts, while broadly looking at their application in the real world.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n",

(2) Programming in the C language, a general-purpose programming language which also has low-level features for systems programming. (3) An introduction to algorithms, including searching, sorting, graph algorithms and asymptotic complexity. Examples and assignments reinforce and refine those first seen in PAC I and often connect directly to topics in the core computer science graduate courses, such as Programming Languages, Fundamental Algorithms, and Operating Systems</p>\n",

Students will talk to customers, partners, competitors, as they encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how a startup actually works. They will work in teams learning how to turn a great idea into a great company. They will learn how to use a business model to brainstorm each part of a company and customer development to get out of the classroom to see whether anyone would want/use their product. Finally, based on the customer and market feedback gathered, students will use agile development to rapidly iterate their products to build something customers would actually use and buy.

Once a good definition is established for a particular object, the emphasis will be on constructing examples that provably satisfy the definition.

The goal of this course is to teach the skills needed for success in real-world information technology via a combination of classroom lectures and practical experience with large projects that have been specified by local “clients.” The typical clients are primarily companies, but can also be government agencies or nonprofit organizations. Each project lasts for the entire semester and is designed to involve the full software project life cycle. Examples of such projects are development of software to solve a business problem, including specifying requirements, writing and testing prototype code, and writing a final report; and evaluation of commercial software to be purchased to address a business problem, including gathering requirements, designing an architecture to connect the new software with existing systems, and assessing the suitability of available software products.</p>\n",

Topics include: (1) Assembly language programming for the Intel chip family, emphasizing computer organization, the Intel x86 instruction set, the logic of machine addressing, registers and the system stack. (2) Programming in the C language, a general-purpose programming language which also has low-level features for systems programming. (3) An introduction to algorithms, including searching, sorting, graph algorithms and asymptotic complexity. Examples and assignments reinforce and refine those first seen in PAC I and often connect directly to topics in the core computer science graduate courses, such as Programming Languages, Fundamental Algorithms, and Operating Systems</p>\n",

This is a practical class – essentially a lab, not a theory or “book” class. The goal, within the constraints of a classroom and a limited amount of time, is to create an entrepreneurial experience for students with all of the pressures and demands of the real world in an early stage start up. Students will talk to customers, partners, competitors, as they encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how a startup actually works. They will work in teams learning how to turn a great idea into a great company. They will learn how to use a business model to brainstorm each part of a company and customer development to get out of the classroom to see whether anyone would want/use their product. Finally, based on the customer and market feedback gathered, students will use agile development to rapidly iterate their products to build something customers would actually use and buy. Each day will be a new adventure outside the classroom as students test each part of their business model and then share the hard earned knowledge with the rest of the class.</p>\n",

The idea is to train students to face a new problem, read relevant literature, and come up with a solution. The solution entails winning a contest against other solutions. The winner receives candy. The best solutions become part of an evolving “Omniheurist” Web site that is expected to get many visitors over the years.\n",

Once a good definition is established for a particular object, the emphasis will be on constructing examples that provably satisfy the definition.

       " <p>This is a capstone course that connects students directly with real-world information technology problems. The goal of this course is to teach the skills needed for success in real-world information technology via a combination of classroom lectures and practical experience with large projects that have been specified by local “clients.” The typical clients are primarily companies, but can also be government agencies or nonprofit organizations. Each project lasts for the entire semester and is designed to involve the full software project life cycle. Examples of such projects are development of software to solve a business problem, including specifying requirements, writing and testing prototype code, and writing a final report; and evaluation of commercial software to be purchased to address a business problem, including gathering requirements, designing an architecture to connect the new software with existing systems, and assessing the suitability of available software products.</p>\n",
